# angular-demo

all code is in branch master. this is a simple demo angular project. The file system is not concise, since I created many dialog related components, but didn't put related components in the same directory. Another issue is the calendar component under search bar. Since the application has local notepad, and for angular material, there isn't a suitable modal, and I don't want to add new libraries like bootstrap, so I leave it as it be.
